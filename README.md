To optimize the naïve sequential algorithm of matrix multiplication, I divide the matrixes into smaller blocks size of 64x64. Each block of A is multiplied with the corresponding block of B, and the partial results are accumulated into C. To achieve a multithreaded approach, I first fetched the hardware’s concurrency level. Hardware concurrency is the ability of a computer’s hardware to perform multiple operations at the same time. Your hardware can only run a limited number of threads at the same time. It leads to faster overall processing and more efficient multitasking. Each thread is responsible for a range of rows in the output matrix C, applying the block multiplication within that region.
